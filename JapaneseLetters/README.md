Japanese Letters
==========

Simple web application to study Japanese Hiragana or Katakana letters.  Application displays letters in infinite loop and in random order.  While running application, you can switch between Hiragana or Katakana.

I found this application very effective when I started to study hiragana and katakana letters. Application is completely responsive, so you can run it from almost any device.
